## PROJECT EXPLANATION

In this assignment  we were asked to create a Pokemons Game in which given a weighted graph, a set of “Agents” that located on it so they could “catch” as many “Pokemons” as possible.
An important detail is that every pokemon has a different value of points  and we need to collect as many points as possible .
The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take (aka walk) the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon .
As we can see we are given a specific and limited time and moves ,clearly the moves are dependents on the distance of the pokemons from the agents.(edges and weights).
Our mission is to maximize the overall sum of weights of the “grabbed” pokemons.
